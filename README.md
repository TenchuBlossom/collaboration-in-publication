# collaboration-in-publication

Refereed journal papers take a significant amount of time and effort to bring to publication.
Scientists can be under a variety of pressures to collaborate in their research and publication writing: some funding bodies or governments encourage collaboration (for instance the
EU encourages international collaboration); some research groups might encourage multiple
authorship to strengthen the cohesion of the group.
Collaboration in a journal publication is defined as a journal paper that has more than one
author. Collaborations can be classed into three groups:

1. Local – all authors work at the same institution.
2. National – all authors work in one country but from more than one institution within
that country.
3. International – at least one author works in a different country from one or more other
authors.

(You may have to make a decision as to how you classify authors who work in different
parts of a large organization, for instance, does a paper with one author who works at one
part of Microsoft UK and another author who works at another part of Microsoft UK count as
“local” or “national”? There may be other classification problems to be solved. The important
point is to define your classification and apply it consistently.)
There is some debate as to whether collaboration has an improving effect on research quality.
Quality is extremely difficult to measure. One easy measure is counting the number of citations
of a paper (or at least citations in high quality publications). It is not at all certain that citation
count is a measure of quality — it may be that multiple-authored papers are more highly cited
because researchers cite people rather than papers — hence a multiple-authored paper will be
more highly cited.

## Research Questions
Unfortunately, this exercise cannot be so thorough as to answer all these questions. Instead it
concentrates on the following research questions:
1. Is there a significantly different rate of collaborative work amongst different journals?
2. Has the pattern of collaboration changed over time?
3. Is there a significant difference in quality of research (as measured by number of citations)
set against number of collaborators?
